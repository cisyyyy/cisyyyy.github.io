This is Cisy writing an intro to this blog post.  So introlicioius.
Actually, I don't know how to write a fantastic blog. Anyway, I'm gonna try it out.

## 1. Here is one thing I want to say

To start with, I'd like to introduce myself simply.

Currently(2025), I'm a rising senior. Like most students, I go to school for classes, and go back home to review for exams. Sounds boring, right?
Sometimes I think so. Therefore, I'm willing to throw myself into some interesting activities.

Fencing is my favorite; it's the sport I've played for over 10 years, and I'd like to develop it as a lifelong hobby.

In my spare time, I may take photos. I don't acquire professional photography skills; I just record whatever I think is beautiful. When I look back onto my album, these photos always delight me.

Hmm... In fact, I'm also a starchaser, and I'm a fan of certain K-POP stars. I have to admit that I will sometimes fall in love with a star cuz he/she is handsome/beautiful, but falling in love with them is reasonable, isn't it?

The activities listed above are the major of the things I do in my free time. If I have to conclude my personality from those activities, I think it's hard to define. Actually, I don't think my personality is easy to tell.
Maybe somewhat enthuastic, friendly, or funny. My friends have different opnions about my personality, and I think it's great to have multi-dimentional comments.

How do I like, this is a question for me and for my friends, and I'd love to make more friends to get more answers about the question!

## 2. Another thing

Please read the first thing written above. I don't have much thing to say. Haha.

## 3. A third thing

This thing is also improtant. You may wonder why I didn't write this in the first thing, and the answer is that it worths being talked individually! (In fact, I forgot it when I'm writing the first one.)

The thing is that I love to eat!!!! I have a dream that is trying all the classical and delicious dishes around the world! I think the assumption sounds really great. Haha!

## 4. Thing #4.

There's no much to say, so I'd love to recommend some refreshing albums which are of my favorites.(just a photo of it)

## 5. The last thing

The end.
